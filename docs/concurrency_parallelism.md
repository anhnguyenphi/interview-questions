# Concurrency vs Parallelism

- Concurrency means that multiple tasks are making process at the same time. For example, we can open browser can read a 
website, listen to music, download and so on. 1 CPU core can only  run 1 thread at a period of time, but it can switch very fast between two
threads.

- Parallelism means that each task is broken into sub-tasks which can be processed in parallel. For example, when you use IDM to download a file from
internet, it breaks this file into many parts that can be downloaded in parallel.
